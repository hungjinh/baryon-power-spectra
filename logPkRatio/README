Table body : log10(Pk_hydro/Pk_dmo) 
1st column : log10(k), with k in unit h/Mpc (comoving scale)
  (PkRatios are accurate over a range of k= [0.1, 30] for Eagle/MB2/Illustris and of k=[0.1, 10] for OWLS,
   but they are extrapolated to k=1500 h/Mpc. 
   For details of PkRatio computation/accuracy/extrapolation, see Appendix of arxiv:1809.01146.)
