Table body : log10(Pk_hydro/Pk_dmo) 
1st column : log10(k), with k in unit h/Mpc (comoving scale)
  (PkRatios are accurate over a range of k= [0.1, 30] for Eagle/MB2/Illustris and of k=[0.1, 10] for OWLS,
   but they are extrapolated to k=1500 h/Mpc. 
   For details of PkRatio computation/accuracy/extrapolation, see Appendix of arxiv:1809.01146.)

Note:
- cowls_AGN_T8.0 is bascially consistent with owls_AGN
- logPkRatio_HzAGN_raw.dat is constructed from the data release of Chisari+18. But the PkRatio at large scale (small k) is not converging to 1, causing by simulation settings as discussed in Appendix B of [van Daalen+20](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00968.pdf). We thus perform a renormalization on the small-k range of PkRatio for Horizon-AGN, and store the tuned PkRatio in logPkRatio_HzAGN.dat .
