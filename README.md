- The computation of power spectra from simulation snapshots of the [Eagle](http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/), [Illustris](https://www.illustris-project.org), [Illustris-TNG](https://www.tng-project.org), [MassiveBlack-II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0888) simulations is detailed in the Appendix A of [Huang+18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01146.pdf).

- The interpolation method of P_hydro(k,z)/P_dmo(k, z) for k > 10 $h^{-1}$Mpc is described in detail in the Appendix B of [Huang+18](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01146.pdf).
